3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Select your repository: liamseamus1198-design/roofing-lead-system
5. Build settings:
   - Build command: npm install
   - Publish directory: public
6. Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard
7. Deploy

### 2. Vercel (Alternative)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/
2. Create NEW project (different name)
3. Import repository
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy

### 3. Heroku (Full-featured)
1. Go to: https://heroku.com/
2. Create new app
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy

### 4. Railway (Modern Alternative)

4. Add environment variables

## Environment Variables Required:
```
EMAIL_USER = your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS = your-gmail-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL = your-admin@gmail.com
SESSION_SECRET = 496839bb01ccc96baefd75244a400250f439cbb7265ecb71dd240d507e4ef463
```

## Testing Your Deployment:
1. Visit your website URL
2. Test the lead form
3. Check email notifications
4. Test storm maps
5. Verify mobile responsiveness

## Troubleshooting:
- If Vercel shows authentication errors, try Netlify
- If email doesn't work, check Gmail App Password
- If forms don't submit, check environment variables
- If images don't load, check file paths

## Success Indicators:
✅ Website loads without authentication
✅ Lead form submits successfully
✅ Email notifications received
✅ Storm maps display properly
✅ Mobile design works correctly
✅ Fast loading times (<3 seconds)
